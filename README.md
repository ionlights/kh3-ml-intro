# KnightHacks 3: The Universe of Possibilities Just Widened with Machine Learning

**TL;DR:** Drop by to learn about how Machine Learning (ML) works, how to write-up your own ML models, how to setup remote workloads to train your models, and get introduced to some of the APIs you have access to which can do quite a bit of your ML for you without training a model!

**Table of Contents:**
- Installation / Setup
- **Part 1:** Intro to Machine Learning
- **Part 2:** DevOps for Machine Learning

## Installation / Setup
**You only need to install Anaconda on your machine. _This will take the better part of 30 minutes to download and install._**
- Grab the "Anaconda Installer" for [Windows][conda-win], [MacOS][conda-mac], or [Linux][conda-lnx].
- Follow the instructions on setting up for [Windows][setup-win], [MacOS][setup-mac], or [Linux][setup-lnx].

[conda-win]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Windows-x86_64.exe
[conda-mac]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
[conda-lnx]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
[setup-win]: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/
[setup-mac]: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/
[setup-lnx]: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/

## **Part 1:** Intro to Machine Learning
